                       <h2>Problem statement: Redundant road construction has caused many traffic problems in Columbia, South Carolina.
                            </h2>
                        
                           <p>
                            South Carolina roads are known for having some of the worst potholes causing pain to both the driver 
                            and the car's tires. This causes congestion that leads to traffic accidents as people try to merge too quickly 
                               at improper times in order to not stay stuck in traffic. Many of these road problems are due to the terrain
                               and construction of Columbia's roads. Geographically, Columbia sits upwards atop a hill and has many steep hilly roads
                               that are prone to erosion cracking. This is the determining cause behind the terrible road quality and why there is constant 
                               construction being done every day in the city.
