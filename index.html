                   <p>
                    South Carolina roads are known for having some of the worst potholes causing pain to both the driver 
                    and the car's tires. This can cause unsafe driving conditions with many cars either slowing down or swerving to
                    avoid potholes along with repeated visits to the mechanic shop for new tires.
