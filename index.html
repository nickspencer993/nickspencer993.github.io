                   <h2>Problem statement: Redundant traffic congestion in Columbia, South Carolina. </h2>
                    
                       <p>
                        Every day Columbia's roads are at a constant gamble for either being under construction or having the most
                        bottlenecked traffic ever. Many drivers might also notice the decrepitness in the roads as many are filled 
                        with potholes. Columbia also has some of the weirdest irregular turns with weary line markers making it 
                        sometimes hard to figure out whether or not you are even in your lane. These road problems usually get magnified
                        with constant construction being done every day on many roads in the city. This creates detours causing many 
                        impatient drivers to cut each other off in order to avoid traffic. This can cause accidents 
                        as irritated drivers quickly merge on narrow roads. Geographically, Columbia sits upwards
                        atop a hill and has many steep hilly roads that are prone to erosion cracking. This is the determining cause 
                        behind the terrible road quality and why there is constant construction being done every day on the city roads.
